## Demo of the application

- When adding a new bookmark, the system:
  - Automatically places it into the most appropriate existing folder if a similar one is found.
  - Determines suitability based on the similarity of the new bookmark's tags or content to the bookmarks already in that folder.

- In this demo, I am showcasing how a user can create a **Smart Space** by searching for bookmarks.
- Since it is a Smart Space, the user wonâ€™t need to manually manage it.
- Any new bookmark that is related to the tags of existing bookmarks within this Smart Space will automatically be saved there.
- The demo also covers how to delete a bookmark from the Smart Space.
